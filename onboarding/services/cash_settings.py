"""A company's cash denominations follow its currency.

When a company's currency is set or changed, ``entity_cash_setting`` gets one row per ACTIVE
``cash_info`` row of that currency (``is_active`` true, the catalogue's ``display_order``).
Rows for any other currency are deleted, because a company counts one currency's cash.
Rows already present for the new currency are left alone, so a company's own on/off and
order survive a re-save -- the sync is idempotent.

Flask's ``blueprints/entity/services/cash_settings.py`` is the same rule for the settings
pages; change the two together.
